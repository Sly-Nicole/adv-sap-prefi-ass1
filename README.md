## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
   Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
   a. Loose Coupling - it allows for flexibility and easier maintenance because in one service do not affect others. it also reduces dependecies between services.
   b. Interoperability - because SAO uses standards for communication, it ensures the smooth communication between different services. Integration of different kinds of systems and application is possible even thou they are built with different technologies.
   c. Reusability - It reduces redundancy and minimize operational costs to the enterprise, it also enchance consistency, and time.

3. Define Microservices.
   Microservices, also known as the microservices architecture, is an architectural style that structures a software application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each microservice represents a specific business capability and runs as a separate process, communicating with other microservices through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
   a. Scalability - Microservices has the ability to perform well based on the organizations need, it will be able to adapat even in increase demand overtime.
   b.Modularity and Flexibility - It allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual services, making it resilient, with failures in one service not affectign the entrire system.
   c.Technology Diversity - It allows the use of different programming languages and technologies, giving the flexibility that promotes innovation.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

Similarities 1. Service-Oriented - Both SOA and microservices emphasize the use of services as essential building blocks, as their name implies they both offer services wether its small or huge.
2.Reusability - They both encourage the reuse of services to improve efficiencvy and reduce redundancy
3.Interoperability - They both ensures that services can work together seamlessly wether they are both created with the same technology or not.
Difference 1. Size and Score - As their Implies SOA tend to be larger and more comprehensive while on the otherhand Microservices focuses on components that represent specific business capabilities. 2. Data Management - SOA relies of centralized data store, while microservices often have their own databases. 3. Deployment - SOA is deployed as a whole or part of larger application while Microservices are independent deployable, allowing for granular releases.
